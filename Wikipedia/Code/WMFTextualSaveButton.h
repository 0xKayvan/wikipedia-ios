/**
 *  RTL-compliant control which lays out a save button (bookmark icon) and text.
 *
 *  @warning
 *  This class hard-codes images and text according to its @c selected state. Anything set in Interface Builder will
 *  be overwritten.
 *
 *  @discussion
 *  Also, AutoLayout constraints are used to ensure RTL compliance across iOS 8 & 9. Initial implementaion of a textual
 *  save button used @c UIButton "out of the box" with @c titleEdgeInsets to space the icon & text.  The problems with
 *  this approach were:
 *
 *    - iOS 8: Icon & text were still LTR when device was set to RTL language.<br/>
 *    - iOS 9: Icon & text were overlapping each other since the inset wasn't also flipped.
 *
 *  The iOS 9 issue could've been worked around easily enough by flipping the inset (and setting the
 *  @c contentHorizontalAlignment), but a custom control was needed for complete RTL compliance in iOS 8 & 9. See
 *  https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T121681 for more information, including screenshots.
