Install / build commands:

  cd Wikipedia/assets/

  git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/pcs-html-converter.git

  cd pcs-html-converter

  npm install

  git submodule update --init --recursive

  npm run -s build


Then delete these since we don't need them post-build and there's no need to bundle them with assets:
  .git
  .gitignore
  .gitmodules
  *.html (except index.html - keep that one)
  *.json
  node_modules
  mobileapps
