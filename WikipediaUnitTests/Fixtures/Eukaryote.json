Flagella and cilia are sometimes referred to as [[undulipodia]],<ref>[[Lynn Margulis]], Heather I.

They are composed mainly of [[tubulin]]. These are entirely distinct from prokaryotic flagellae. They are supported by a bundle of microtubules arising from a [[centriole]], characteristically arranged as nine doublets surrounding two singlets. Flagella also may have hairs, or [[mastigoneme]]s, as in many [[Stramenopile]]s, and scales connecting membranes and internal rods. Their interior is continuous with the cell\'s [[cytoplasm]].\n\nMicrofilamental structures composed of [[actin]] and actin binding proteins, e.g., α-[[actinin]], [[fimbrin]], [[filamin]] are present in submembranous cortical layers and bundles, as well. [[Motor protein]]s of microtubules, e.g., [[dynein]] or [[kinesin]] and actin, e.g., [[myosins]] provide dynamic character of the network.\n\n[[Centrioles]] are often present even in cells and groups that do not have flagella, but [[conifer]]s and [[flowering plant]]s have neither. They generally occur in groups that give rise to various microtubular roots. These form a primary component of the cytoskeletal structure, and are often assembled over the course of several cell divisions, with one flagellum retained from the parent and the other derived from it. Centrioles produce the spindle during nuclear division.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Vorobjev IA, Nadezhdina ES | title = The centrosome and its role in the organization of microtubules | volume = 106 | pages = 227–293 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3294718 | doi = 10.1016/S0074-7696(08)61714-3 | isbn = 978-0-12-364506-7 | series = International Review of Cytology }}</ref>\n\nThe significance of cytoskeletal structures is underlined in the determination of shape of the cells, as well as their being essential components of migratory responses like [[chemotaxis]] and [[chemokinesis]].
