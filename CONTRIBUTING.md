# Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to the project, you can find our current product, bug, and engineering backlogs on the [iOS App Phabricator project board](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/view/782/). Once you pick a task, make sure you assign it to yourself to ensure nobody else duplicates your work.  The **#Easy** tag in Phabricator can also help you find tasks that are ideal for new contributors because they're small and/or well-defined.  We suggest you [filter the tasks to only show tasks tagged with **#Easy** ](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/782/query/hv02nri.Imqj/).

Before developing, please read the [setup instructions](README.md).

We do all of our active development on the [develop](https://github.com/wikimedia/wikipedia-ios) branch. Your pull requests will automatically be targeted at that branch by Github. To make merging easier, be sure you create your branches based on the develop branch.

Once your contributions are ready for review, add yourself in alphabetical order under contributors in `Code/AboutViewController.plist` and post a pull request on GitHub. One of the maintainers will review the PR. Thanks for contributing! ðŸŽ‰
