# Internationalization
As you'd expect, given [Wikipedia's mission](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Mission_statement) and [core values](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Values), making the iOS app accessible & usable in as many languages as possible is very important to us.  This document is a quick overview of how we localize strings as well as the app itself.

## Localized strings
Localized strings which are used by the app are all kept in **Localizable.strings**.  We do not use localized string entries generated by Interface Builder because the keys aren't human readable.
### Strings displayed in the app
#### Adding a new localized string
Currently, we're not using `NSLocalizedString` directly.  This isn't ideal for a couple of reasons, but the current workflow for adding a new localized string is as follows:

1. Add an entry to **Localizations/en.lproj/Localizable.strings** with the English version of your string, using a hyphenated, lowercase key. For example, `"my-new-key" = "Hello world.";`.
2. Add another entry to **Localizations/qqq.lproj/Localizable.strings** with a description of what this localization is for. For example, `"my-new-key" = "Label for a button that does a thing.";`.
3. Retrieve your string by the chosen key:
  - ObjC: `MWKLocalizedString(@"my-new-key", nil);`
  - Swift: `localizedStringForKeyFallingBackOnEnglish(key)`

See `WMFLocalization.h` for more details.

#### Modifying a localized string
**Do not change the keys for localized strings.** Unless absolutely necessary, keys should remain the same to prevent complications when syncing with TWN.

### Importing translations
Translations are imported from [translatewiki.net](https://translatewiki.net) using the workflow documented on [mediawiki.org translation doc](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Translation_of_app_string_resources#TWN_sync_for_iOS).

### Displaying text in the app
_TODO: elaborate on considerations when displaying text in the app, e.g. overflow/multiline for verbose languages, RTL handling, etc._

### Navigating the app
_TODO: elaborate on considerations when implementing navigation in the app, i.e. RTL handling_
